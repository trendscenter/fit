fMRI-fMRI data fusion:

The data-set consists of two participant groups (schizophrenia patients and healthy controls) matched for age and gender all of whom were scanned on two fMRI paradigms [the auditory oddball task, and the Sternberg working memory task]. Both tasks have been found to show activation differences in schizophrenia patients. The auditory oddball evoked response is one of the most robust findings in electrophysiology and the associated fMRI involvement reveals robust differences in patients with schizophrenia by activating regions involved in target detection or attentional orienting. Working memory is also compromised in schizophrenia, and fMRI activation differences have been identified for the Sternberg working memory task.
