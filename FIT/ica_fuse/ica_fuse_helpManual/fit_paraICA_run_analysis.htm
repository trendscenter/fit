<hr>

When you click <em><a href="fit_paraICA.htm" class="style2">Run Analysis</a></em> 
button and had selected the parameter file "para_ica_fusion.mat", parallel ICA will be
run. The analysis steps are as follows:

<ul>
<li> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - PCA is run on each modality
separately. The number of components extracted for each modality
depends on the number you have entered during <em>
<a href="fit_paraICA_setup_analysis.htm" class="style2">Setup Analysis</a></em>. PCA information is
stored in a file with suffix "para_ica_pca.mat". </li>

<li> Parallel ICA - ICA is run on each modality and a correlation
measure is enforced between the modalities during the analysis.
Correlation measure is dependent on the type of parallel ICA. There
are two types of parallel ICA like "AA" and "AS". "AA" enforces the
correlation measure between mixing coefficient of modality 1 with
mixing coefficient of modality 2 whereas "AS" uses correlation
measure between the mixing coefficient of modality 1 with the source
of modality 2. ICA information is stored in a file with suffix
"para_ica_ica.mat". </li>

</ul>


<strong>Note:</strong> All the analysis information is stored in a log file with suffix "para_ica_results.log".
