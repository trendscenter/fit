<p class="style6"><strong>Sort Joint ICA Components</strong></p>
<hr>
<p class="style4">

<font size="3">In order to sort joint ICA components, statistics toolbox must be
installed. Select "Yes" for "Do You Want To Sort Joint ICA
Components?" in <a class="style2" href="fit_display_gui.htm">display GUI</a>. Figure
1 shows the utility to sort components. The
parameters in the figure 1 are explained below:

</font> 

<ul> 

<li> <span class="style5">"Select sorting criteria" - Presently there are two options
like "ttest2 on mixing coeff" and "Spatial div". Explanation of each
option is given below: </span> 

<ul>

<li class="style5"> "ttest2 on mixing coeff" - Two sample t-test is done on mixing
coefficients between the selected groups. Figure 2 shows components sorted based on
p-value. The results from two sample t-test are stored in a text
file with suffix 'ttest2_mixing_coeff.txt'.
</li>

<li class="style5"> "Spatial div" - To calculate spatial divergence between the groups, 
a distribution must be created for each component of a
group. We use cross-task histogram as distribution for each selected
group from spatial maps. You need to select the features from
features listbox and groups from groups listbox (Figure 1). Divergence is calculated between
the selected groups. Figure 3 shows components sorted based on spatial divergence. The results
from divergence are stored in a text file with suffix
'divergence_groups.txt'. </li>

</ul>

</li>

<li> <span class="style5">"Select Type of Histogram" - There are two types of histograms like "Feature" and
"Component". We explain the type of histograms below: 

</span> 

<ul>

<li class="style5"> Feature - Z-threshold is applied on each component map of a feature and voxels are sorted in descending order. The resulting set of voxels
is used as a mask to original data. Cross-task histogram is computed
based on the selected features from features listbox. </li>

<li class="style5"> Component - Component voxels for each feature are sorted in descending order. Cross-task histogram for each
component is generated based on selected features from features
listbox. </li>

</ul>

<li class="style5"> "Select Z-threshold" - This option is available only when
you select "Spatial div" as the sorting criteria and select
"Feature" as type of histogram. </li>

<li class="style5"> "Groups" - Select at most two groups for sorting components. </li>

<li class="style5"> "Features" - You can select features only when "Spatial div"
is used as the sorting criteria. </li>
</ul>
<span class="style4"><font size="3">When you click </font> <em><font size="3">Done</font></em><font size="3"> button, components are sorted based on the criteria 
selected. <br />
<br />
</font>
<strong><font size="3">Note:</font></strong></span>
<ul>

<li class="style5"> Options for divergence criteria are "kl" (Kullback Leibler), "J"
(J), "alpha" (Alpha) and "renyi" (Renyi). For setting the appropriate divergence 
criteria see <a class="style2" href="fit_defaults.htm">defaults</a> (&#39;ica_fuse_defaults.m&#39;). You can change the number of bins used in calculating histogram
by changing variable NUM_BINS (See &#39;<a href="fit_defaults.htm" class="style2">ica_fuse_defaults.m</a>&#39;). </li>

<li class="style5"> You can open a spatial map or EEG signal in a different 
figure when you double click or click on the corresponding axis. </li>
<li class="style5"> Option is provided to plot cross-task histograms when you 
use right click on the loading coefficients axis.</li>

</ul>
